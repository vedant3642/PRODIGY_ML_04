# ‚úã Hand Gesture Recognition for Human-Computer Interaction
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system that can recognize various hand gestures in real time or from static images. The system uses computer vision for hand detection and preprocessing, and a trained classifier (CNN/SVM) for gesture classification.

## üîç Features:
Real-time video and static image input support

Preprocessing: skin filtering, contour detection, hand segmentation

ML/CNN-based gesture classification

Modular design for integration into gesture-controlled applications

## Tech Stack:
Python, OpenCV

TensorFlow / PyTorch (for CNN model)

MediaPipe (optional for hand tracking)

scikit-learn / SVM (alternative for lightweight models)
